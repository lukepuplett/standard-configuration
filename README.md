# Introduction 
This .NET Standard library should contain types useful when working with configuration.

For example, it currently contains classes for reading from dictionaries and application settings into strongly-typed models that you write and decorate with attributes from the DataAnnotations namespace. The validator in this library can then ensure that configuration is as expected.
